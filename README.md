Production Performance Dashboard Analysis


This project focuses on developing and analyzing a production performance dashboard to track and optimize manufacturing operations across multiple regions and product types. Using Excel Pivot Tables, the dashboard consolidates key production data and delivers actionable insights for cost reduction and enhanced production efficiency.

Key Features
Data Cleaning: Processed raw production data, removing inconsistencies and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Pivot Tables: Leveraged Excelâ€™s Pivot Tables for summarizing metrics such as:
Units Produced
Total Production Cost
Production Cost Per Unit
Trend Analysis: Monitored trends in production efficiency across regions, managers, and product types.
Visualization: Created a user-friendly dashboard for business intelligence and decision-making.
Technologies Used
Excel (Pivot Tables, Data Cleaning, Visualization)
Data Analysis (Cost Efficiency, Production Metrics)
Dataset
